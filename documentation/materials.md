## DIY1/2/3 Housing
The housing design is from [this project](https://coastal.msstate.edu/waves) by the Mississippi State University's [Coastal Research and Extension Center](https://coastal.msstate.edu/). See [this video](https://youtu.be/9Ifw1qYnSB8) ([@10:44](https://youtu.be/9Ifw1qYnSB8?t=644) for cap, [@22:15](https://youtu.be/9Ifw1qYnSB8?t=1335) for body) for a demonstration of how they assemble their sensors. Note that we use different hardware / electronics, but the housing is the same.
